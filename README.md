TODO:
- Test that all functions work on Windows (originally coded on Linux)
- Update the .gitignore to allow for post-processed data files (e.g. Tracks, Groups, Events, etc.)
- Update the terminology to be in-line with the paper
- - From code -> paper, the conversions needed are:
- - groups -> events
- - events -> configs
