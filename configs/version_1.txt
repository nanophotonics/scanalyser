##### Generic Settings #####
# The chosen Particles (i.e. scans) to form Events
## If you want all particles use: particles all
## This option does not cover the particles that are used to form Tracks/Groups and affinity matrix in peak correlations (all are used in these cases)
particles Particle_0284 Particle_0506 Particle_0865 Particle_1045 Particle_1362

# Prefix for all filepaths inside of the ./analysis directory
## E.g. If you are using all particles you could use: name allscans
## E.g. If you were only using a subset of particles you could use: name subsetscans
name subsetscans

# Which molecule dataset to use for analysis (i.e. post-CAE)
## Options: BPT, BPT_new
molecule BPT


##### CAE Settings #####
# CAE version number (CAE is trained on all scans regardless of name/particles options)

##### Siamese-CNN Settings #####
# Siamese-CNN pre-trained version number
## Leave the 's_ver' option blank to use the default model ('siamese_v1')

# Siamese-CNN fine-tuned version number
## Leave the 's_ver_ft' option blank to use the default model ('finetune_v1')

# Whether or not to store the learned weights/loss curves during pre-training
s_record False

# Whether or not to store the learned weights/loss curves during fine-tuning
s_record_ft False

# Number of epochs during pre-training
s_epochs 1000
